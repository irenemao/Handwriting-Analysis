# Handwriting-Analysis
Handwriting analysis has demonstrated relationships between changes in handwriting and PD. There are three main components of the analysis which are feature extraction, feature selection, classification and our goal was to establish a machine learning based classification model to differentiate between PD groups and healthy groups. The analysis was completed based on two existing datasets from PaHaW and ParkinsonHW.
